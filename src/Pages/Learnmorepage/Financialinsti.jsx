              The past few years have seen unprecedented stress in global
              capital markets. The markets are going through a time of
              volatility, financing uncertainty, and rapidly evolving business
              models. On the regional front the markets are characterized by low
              capitalization and liquidity, but the region is leveraging from
              the experience of West Africa especially in moving towards
              integration and harmonization of the regional Capital Markets.
              Whether this will be successfully achieved both at a legal and
              operational level remains to be seen.
